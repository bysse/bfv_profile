# BFV profile

BFV profile is a simple script hack to show profile statistics from the Battlefield V.
It pulls data regularly and shows the K/D and other stats since the last data fetch.
This way you can see where you're going instead of relying on the overall statistics 
which are very slow moving depending on your playtime.

## How to run
 
 Make sure you have Python 3 installed or available then run.
 
     python3 bfv_profile.py <BFV profile>
